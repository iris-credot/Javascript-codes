# Javascript Projects.
This repository contains different projects of Javascript.
## Dogs.js
```
This function converts your age from “human years” to “dog years”.
Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. How old would you be if you were a dog?
```
##  Kelvin.js
```
This will convert temperature in kelvin to both degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit.
```
## Meal.js
``` This function can generate a meal and a price for Today’s Special without any embarrassing errors!
```
## Paper.js
```Rock paper scissors is a classic two-player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.

The possible outcomes are:

.Rock destroys scissors.
.Scissors cut paper.
.Paper covers rock.
.If there’s a tie, then the game ends in a draw.
Our code will break the game into four parts:

1.Get the user’s choice.
2.Get the computer’s choice.
3.Compare the two choices and determine a winner.
4.Start the program and display the results.
```
##  Race.js
```
This function will deal with adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). They can register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time-based on their age and registration.

Race number:

Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.
All others receive a number below 1000.
Start time:

Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.
Early adults run at 9:30 am.
Late adults run at 11:00 am.
Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).
```
## Sleep.js
```
Did you know that giraffes sleep 4.6 hours a dayLinks to an external site.? We humans need more than that. If we don’t sleep enough, we accumulate sleep debt. In this project we’ll calculate if you’re getting enough sleep each week using a sleep debt calculator.

The program will determine the actual and ideal hours of sleep for each night of the last week.
```
## Team.js
```This function creates, retrieves, and adds information about your favorite sports team. Basketball, soccer, tennis, or water polo, you pick it. 
```
##  Training .js
```
As a seasoned athlete, one of your favorite activities is running marathons. You use a service called Training Days that sends you a message for the event you signed up for and the days you have left to train.

Since you also code, Training Days has asked you to help them solve a problem: The program currently uses the wrong scope for its variables. They know this can be troublesome as their service evolves. In this project you will make Training Days more maintainable and less error-prone by fixing variable scopes.
```
##  Whale.js
```
Take a phrase like ‘turpentine and turtles’ and translate it into its “whale talk” equivalent: ‘UUEEIEEAUUEE’.

There are a few simple rules for translating text to whale language:

There are no consonants. Only vowels excluding “y”.
The u‘s and e‘s are extra long, so we must double them in our program.
Once we have converted text to the whale language, the result is sung slowly, as is a custom in the ocean.
